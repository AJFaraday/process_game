Process Game
------------

A curiostiy project by Andrew Faraday, using the Gosu library to create a game which follows a process with relatively little user interaction.


You probably need to do this first...
```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libpango1.0-dev \
                     libgl1-mesa-dev libfreeimage-dev libopenal-dev libsndfile-dev
bundle install
```
